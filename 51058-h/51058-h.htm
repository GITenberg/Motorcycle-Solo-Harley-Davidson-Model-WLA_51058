<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> This 2‐cylinder solo motorcycle is powered by a V‐type,
air‐cooled gasoline engine, operating on conventional 4‐stroke, 4‐cycle
principles. Air‐cooled engines rely upon movement of air over cylinder
and head radiating fins, and upon circulation of oil for dissipation
of excessive heat. Motorcycle engines, therefore, under no conditions
should be operated for more than 1 minute when motorcycle is not in
motion.</p>

<p><b>i. Steering Damper.</b> Steering damper is an adjustable
friction device to damper turning action of forks, steady front wheel,
and prevent wobble in rough terrain or at high speeds, and is located
on top of steering head in center of handle bars. Move handle to right
to apply desired friction.</p>

<p><b>j. Foot Starter Crank</b> &#40;<a href="#fig_1">fig. 1</a>&#41;. The foot starter crank
is located on right side of motorcycle. Gear shifter lever must be in
neutral position, and clutch foot pedal in forward engaged position,
before using foot starter crank. Starter crank normally is in upward
position. Straddle motorcycle, place right foot on starter crank, and
shift weight of body for forceful downward crank operation to start
engine.</p>

<p><b>k. Ignition and Light Switch.</b> Earlier models are
provided with switch lock, later models are nonlocking. Switch is off
in straight‐forward position. First position to right is for engine
ignition only.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span> Second position to right is for ignition and blackout
lights. To use vehicle service lights, depress button to turn switch to
third right position.</p>

<p><b>l. Instrument Panel Signal Lights.</b> Instead of an ammeter
and oil pressure gage, signal lights indicate generator charging, and
engine oil pressure.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Green light is located on left side of instrument panel. When
engine is running, and light is out, it indicates generator is charging.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Red light is located on right side of instrument panel. When engine
is running, and light is out, it indicates engine oil is circulating.</p>

<p><b>m. Carburetor Choke</b> &#40;<a href="#fig_9">fig. 9</a>&#41;. Choke lever is in full
prime position when all the way up, and in normal running position when
all the way down.</p>


<h4 id="para_6">6. ENGINE PRESTARTING INSTRUCTIONS.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Before the engine is started, perform the Before‐operation
Service outlined in paragraph <a href="#para_15">15</a>. Special care must be taken during
starting and warming‐up period to avoid unnecessary engine wear.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> The rider must acquire correct motorcycle engine starting
habits, and learn to do the job the quickest, easiest, and most
dependable way. The following pointers will be helpful to the beginner
as well as to a seasoned rider:</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Mount &#40;straddle&#41; motorcycle to obtain firm grip on handle bars.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Leave side stand &#40;jiffy stand&#41; outward to support vehicle while
operating foot starter crank with right foot.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Engine starting will be benefited by use of front wheel,
hand‐operated brake, to prevent vehicle from rolling or shifting during
starting kicks. This is especially helpful if vehicle is parked on an
incline or on soft, uneven surface.</p>

<p id="para_6c"><b>c.</b> The procedure outlined below is preparatory to starting
either cold, warm, or hot engine:</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Place gear shifter lever in “N” &#40;neutral&#41; position &#40;<a href="#fig_8">fig. 8</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; See that gasoline shut‐off valve is open &#40;<a href="#fig_5">fig. 5</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Engage clutch &#40;<a href="#fig_7">fig. 7</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Spark control &#40;left&#41; grip must be turned inward to fully advanced
position, or nearly so.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Foot starter crank may travel &frac12; way downward before starting
engine. See that a full vigorous starter stroke is used. A vigorous
kick, using a full swing &#40;not a jab&#41; of right leg and hip, is correct
engine starting practice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span></p>


<h4 id="para_7">7. STARTING THE ENGINE.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Procedure for starting cold, warm, or hot motorcycle engines
differs. Therefore, following instructions are used with paragraph <a href="#para_6c">6 c</a>
to cover correct procedure in all three cases.</p>

<p><b>b. Starting Cold Engine.</b> When vehicle has not been
operated for some time, and engine is normally cold, follow progressive
procedure for easiest starting.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Set carburetor choke lever in full upward &#40;closed&#41; position.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Open throttle wide by turning right grip inward as far as it will
go.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Prime cylinders by operating foot starter crank one or two strokes.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Set carburetor choke lever in &frac14; to &frac12; closed position for mild
weather starting: &frac34; closed &#40;or leave fully choked&#41; for extremely cold
weather starting. CAUTION: <i>It is only in extremely cold weather
that engine may start best with choke fully closed, and even then it
will have to be moved from this position immediately after engine is
started.</i></p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Set throttle &#40;right&#41; grip to slightly open position.</p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; Turn ignition switch on, first right position.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Start engine with vigorous strokes of foot starter crank.</p>

<p>&#40;8&#41; When engine starts, set throttle for moderate idling speed for
warming up, or until ready to set vehicle in motion. Do not race engine
unnecessarily.</p>

<p>&#40;9&#41; After engine warms up, and misfires due to an overrich mixture,
gradually move choke lever downward. After engine has thoroughly warmed
up, move choke lever to fully open &#40;downward&#41; position.</p>

<p><b>c. Starting Warm Engine.</b> Following instructions apply
to engine when halfway between hot and cold. With engine in this
condition, carburetor choking must be handled cautiously.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Lift choke lever to first upward position from normal &#40;&frac14; closed&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Set throttle &#40;right&#41; grip to fully closed &#40;outward&#41; position.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Operate foot starter crank one or two strokes.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Set throttle grip to between &frac14; and <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> open position.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Turn ignition switch on.</p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; Start engine with vigorous strokes of foot starter crank.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Soon after engine starts, choke lever must be moved to fully open
&#40;downward&#41; position.</p>

<p>&#40;8&#41; Turn throttle grip to control idling speed of engine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span></p>

<p><b>d. Starting Hot Engine.</b> If engine has been shut off for
only a brief period and is near normal operating temperature, it is not
necessary to use carburetor choke lever. With some engines, depending
upon carburetor condition and adjustment, hot starting is easier and
more dependable if foot starter crank is operated one stroke before
turning ignition switch on.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Close throttle grip by turning fully outward.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Turn ignition switch on.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Operate foot starter crank to start engine.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; When hot engine does not start readily after two or three strokes
of the foot starter crank, it is usually due to an overrich &#40;flooded&#41;
condition, and the proper procedure then is to open throttle wide so
that more air can enter: close throttle quickly after engine starts.
CAUTION: <i>After engine has warmed up to a normal operating temperature,
do not allow engine to stand idling for longer than a 1 minute
interval.</i></p>

<p><b>e. Starting Engine with Dead Battery.</b> See paragraph <a href="#para_12">12</a>.</p>

<p id="para_7f"><b>f. Behavior of Instrument Panel Signal Lights.</b> Function
of generator &#40;green&#41; signal light depends upon action of cut‐out
relay; engine oil pressure &#40;red&#41; signal light depends upon action
of oil feed pump. Rider must, therefore, thoroughly understand
operating characteristics of both signal lights to judge condition of
generator‐battery circuit and pressure in engine oil circulating system.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; When ignition light switch is turned to first &#40;right&#41; position,
preparatory to starting engine, both green and red signal lights should
go on. CAUTION: <i>When switch is turned on, immediately after engine has
been primed by cranking, red &#40;oil pressure&#41; signal light may not light
at once, but will light after a few seconds, due to oil pressure built
up by cranking, and is most likely to be noticed in cold weather.</i></p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; With engine started and running at medium idling speed, both signal
lights should go off. CAUTION: <i>Should oil pressure &#40;red&#41; signal light
fail to go off at speeds above idling, conditions must be brought to
attention of unit mechanic.</i></p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; At slow idle speed, or under approximately 20 miles per hour road
speed &#40;in high gear&#41;, generator &#40;green&#41; signal light will normally
flash on and off, because at that speed generator voltage output is
very low and unsteady. CAUTION: <i>Should generator &#40;green&#41; signal
light fail to go off at speed above approximately 20 miles per hour,
generator is either not charging at all, or its current output is not
up to normal, and generator should be given attention at once.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>


<h4 id="para_8">8. STOPPING THE ENGINE.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Stop engine only by turning ignition and light switch to off
&#40;straight‐ahead&#41; position, to prevent discharge of battery through
spark coil primary circuit.</p>


<h4 id="para_9">9. OPERATION OF VEHICLE.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a. Starting on Level Ground.</b> The engine having been
warmed up and checked for satisfactory operation, the vehicle &#40;with
operator in riding position&#41; is put in motion as follows:</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Transfer body weight to right leg.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Fold back side stand &#40;jiffy stand&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Disengage clutch by depressing clutch foot pedal with heel of left
foot.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Shift gear shifter lever into “1” &#40;low&#41; gear position.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Slowly engage clutch by depressing clutch foot pedal with toe of
left foot.</p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; When clutch starts to “take hold,” open throttle sufficiently to
maintain engine speed.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Accelerate gradually to between 12 and 15 miles per hour in low
gear.</p>

<p>&#40;8&#41; Close throttle quickly.</p>

<p>&#40;9&#41; Disengage clutch.</p>

<p>&#40;10&#41; Shift through “N” &#40;neutral&#41; position into “2” &#40;second&#41; gear.</p>

<p>&#40;11&#41; Reengage clutch and accelerate to about 25 miles per hour.</p>

<p>&#40;12&#41; Close throttle quickly.</p>

<p>&#40;13&#41; Disengage clutch.</p>

<p>&#40;14&#41; Shift into “3” &#40;high&#41; gear.</p>

<p>&#40;15&#41; Reengage clutch and accelerate to desired speed.</p>

<p><b>b. Starting on Uneven or Soft Ground.</b></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; If standing on an incline or in loose, heavy ground, more engine
power will be required to start vehicle without stalling engine.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; It may be necessary to keep vehicle from rolling by keeping
pressure on front brake hand lever. Brake pressure is released after
vehicle starts in forward motion.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Open throttle and engage clutch at same time to provide power
needed for starting, without racing engine unnecessarily.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Motorcycle starts should be made without excessive application of
power, with consequent unnecessary spinning of rear wheel.</p>


<h4 id="para_10">10. DRIVING PRECAUTIONS.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Practice will enable a rider to judge at what rate of speed
the motorcycle should be moving before he shifts from a lower to
higher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span> gear, and engine should never be permitted to labor unduly,
when a shift of gears, higher to lower, would improve operation.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Operator must not look down at gear shifter when shifting gears,
but keep his eyes on the road ahead. Do not ride the clutch. The
operator’s foot should rest on clutch foot pedal only when he is
operating it. When shifting gears, disengage clutch fully to avoid gear
damage and shifting difficulties. CAUTION: <i>Many transmissions are
ruined through failure to disengage clutch fully when shifting gears.</i></p>

<p><b>b. Braking.</b> Rear wheel service brake must be in such
condition that medium‐hard application will cause rear wheel to lock.
Application of service brake should be gradual, with just enough force
to accomplish desired result.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Auxiliary front wheel brake, when used in conjunction with service
brake, must be applied with caution, especially on wet, muddy, or
slippery roads.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; After passing through water, the brakes should be set slightly, and
the vehicle operated for a short distance, until sufficient heat has
been generated to dry the brakes.</p>

<p><b>c. Avoid Low Gear Operation.</b> Always operate vehicle
in highest gear possible, consistent with tactical situation, speed
required, power required, and kind and nature of road substance, to
prevent overheating of engine.</p>

<p><b>d. High Speed Tips.</b> Only experienced riders should
indulge in high‐speed riding. A motorcycle operated for long distances
at high speed must be given closer than ordinary attention to avoid
serious engine overheating with consequent damage. For better
motorcycle service, apply the following suggestions:</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Develop habit of frequently snapping throttle shut for an instant
when running at high speed. This draws additional lubrication to piston
and cylinder and assists in cooling engine.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; In cool weather, operate engine slowly until it is thoroughly
warmed up, to avoid damage to pistons, rings, cylinders, and other
parts before oil is warm enough to circulate freely.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; If handle bar windshield and leg shields are used, engine is
more likely to overheat with continued high‐speed riding. Watch this
carefully.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Adjust “steering damper” for best control of motorcycle consistent
with riding speed and condition and nature of road.</p>


<h4 id="para_11">11. STOPPING AND PARKING VEHICLE.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a. Stopping Vehicle.</b> Rider will make a “restart” easier
and quicker if he will apply the following instructions upon stopping
vehicle:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Close throttle.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Disengage clutch.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Apply brake &#40;or brakes&#41; to slow vehicle without sliding rear tire.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Just before coming to a complete stop, shift into “N” &#40;neutral&#41;
position and engage clutch. CAUTION: <i>If immediate restart is to be

<h4 id="para_13">13. RUNNING‐IN NEW ENGINE &#40;OR VEHICLE&#41;.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> A new motorcycle engine or newly overhauled engine must be
given proper “break‐in” consideration for at least the first 1,000 to
1,200 miles of service. Failure to do this may result in damage that
will put engine out of active service within a short period of time.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> At the first 250 miles, check front and rear drive chains
to make sure they are receiving required amount of oil for ample
lubrication. If necessary, have chain oilers adjusted by unit mechanic.
Drive chains must be inspected for correct adjustment, and be given
attention by unit mechanic as needed.</p>

<p><b>c.</b> At first 500 miles, drain oil tank and refill with fresh
oil. Check front and rear chains &#40;step b above&#41;. Thereafter, follow
instructions in Maintenance Operation section.</p>

<p><b>d.</b> After a new motorcycle has been run 500 to 1,000 miles it
needs to be thoroughly checked over and any loose screws and nuts
tightened. Particular attention must be given engine and transmission
mounting bolts and nuts, and to rear wheel mounting socket screws.</p>

<p><b>e.</b> Following pointers must be observed when running‐in new
engine or newly overhauled engine:</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Do not exceed 30 miles per hour during first 100 miles.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Do not exceed 35 miles per hour during next 200 miles.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Do not exceed 40 miles per hour during next 400 miles.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Do not exceed 50 miles per hour during next 500 miles.</p>

<h4 id="para_14">14. PURPOSE.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> To insure mechanical efficiency it is necessary that the
vehicle be systematically inspected at intervals each day it is
operated and weekly, so that defects may be discovered and corrected
before they result in serious damage or failure. Certain scheduled
maintenance services will be performed at these designated intervals.
The services set forth in this section are those performed by driver or
crew before operation, during operation, at halt, after operation, and
weekly.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> Driver preventive maintenance services are listed on the back
of “Driver’s Trip Ticket and Preventive Maintenance Service Record,”
W.D. Form No. 48, to cover vehicles of all types and models. Items
peculiar to specific vehicles, but not listed on W.D. Form No. 48, are
covered in manual procedures under the items to which they are related.
Certain items listed on the form that do not pertain to the vehicle
involved are eliminated from the procedures as written into the manual.
Every organization must thoroughly school each driver in performing the
maintenance procedures set forth in manuals, whether or not they are
listed specifically on W.D. Form No. 48.</p>

<p><b>c.</b> The items listed on W.D. Form No. 48 that apply to this
vehicle are expanded in this manual to provide specific procedures for
accomplishment of the inspections and services. These services are
arranged to facilitate inspection and conserve the time of the driver,
and are not necessarily in the same numerical order as shown on W.D.
Form No. 48. The item numbers, however, are identical with those shown
on that form.</p>

<p><b>d.</b> The general inspection of each item applies also to any
supporting member or connection, and generally includes a check to see
whether the item is in good condition, correctly assembled, secure, or
excessively worn.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; The inspection for “good condition” is usually an external visual
inspection to determine whether the unit is damaged beyond safe or
serviceable limits. The term “good condition” is explained further by
the following: not bent or twisted, not chafed or burned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span> not broken
or cracked, not bare or frayed, not dented or collapsed, not torn or
cut.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; The inspection of a unit to see that it is “correctly assembled”
is usually an external visual inspection to see whether it is in its
normal assembled position in the vehicle.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; The inspection of a unit to determine if it is “secure” is usually
an external visual examination, a hand‐feel, or a pry‐bar check for
looseness. Such an inspection should include any brackets, lock
washers, lock nuts, locking wires, or cotter pins used in assembly.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; “Excessively worn” will be understood to mean worn close to, or
beyond, serviceable limits, and likely to result in a failure if not
replaced before the next scheduled inspection.</p>

<p><b>e.</b> Any defects or unsatisfactory operating characteristics
beyond the scope of first echelon to correct must be reported at the
earliest opportunity to the designated individual in authority.</p>


<h4 id="para_15">15. BEFORE‐OPERATION SERVICE.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> This inspection schedule is designed primarily as a check to
see that the vehicle has not been tampered with, or sabotaged since the
After‐operation Service was performed. Various combat conditions may
have rendered the vehicle unsafe for operation and it is the duty of
the driver to determine whether or not the vehicle is in condition to
carry out any mission to which it is assigned. This operation will not
be entirely omitted, even in extreme tactical situations.</p>

<p><b>b. Procedures.</b> Before‐operation Service consists of
inspecting items listed below according to the procedure described,
and correcting or reporting any deficiencies. Upon completion of
the service, results should be reported promptly to the designated
individual in authority.</p>

<h4 id="para_18">18. AFTER‐OPERATION AND WEEKLY SERVICE.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> After‐operation Service is particularly important, because at
this time the driver inspects his vehicle to detect any deficiencies
that may have developed, and corrects those he is permitted to
handle. He should report promptly, to the designated individual in
authority, the results of his inspection. If this schedule is performed
thoroughly, the vehicle should be ready to roll again on a moment’s
notice. The Before‐operation Service, with a few exceptions, is
then necessary only to ascertain whether the vehicle is in the same
condition in which it was left upon completion of the After‐operation
Service. The After‐operation Service should never be entirely omitted,
even in extreme tactical situations, but may be reduced to the bare
fundamental services outlined for the At‐halt Service, if necessary.</p>

<p><b>b. Procedures.</b> When performing the After‐operation
Service, the driver must remember and consider any irregularities
noticed during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span> the day in the Before‐operation. During‐operation, and
At‐halt Services. The After‐operation Service consists of inspecting
and servicing the following items. Those items of the After‐operation
Services that are marked with an asterisk &#40;*&#41; require additional Weekly
services, the procedures for which are indicated in step &#40;<i>b</i>&#41; of each
applicable item.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; <span class="smcap">Item 54, Fuel and Oil.</span> Fill fuel and oil tanks; fill oil

oil as frequently as excessive contamination of the oil occurs</i>.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; <span class="smcap">Item 55, Engine Operation.</span> Test for satisfactory engine
idle without stalling. Accelerate and decelerate engine, noting any
tendency to miss or backfire, unusual noises, or vibration that may
indicate worn parts, loose mounting, incorrect fuel mixture, or
faulty ignition. Investigate any unsatisfactory engine operating
characteristics noted during operation. Learn to recognize noise caused
by loose primary &#40;front&#41; drive chain. Slack in excess of &frac12; inch total
up‐and‐down motion can cause excessive noise which sounds like engine
knock. Remove inspection cover for examination of chain.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; <span class="smcap">Item 57, Horn.</span> If tactical situation permits, test horn.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; <span class="smcap">Item 59, Lights.</span> If tactical situation permits, observe

<h4 id="para_19">19. INTRODUCTION.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Lubrication is an essential part of preventive maintenance,
determining to a great extent serviceability of parts and assemblies.</p>


<h4 id="para_20">20. LUBRICATION GUIDE &#40;<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>&#41;.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a. General.</b> Lubrication instructions for this materiel
are consolidated in a Lubrication Guide &#40;<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>&#41;. These specify the
points to be lubricated, the periods of lubrication, and the lubricant
to be used. Intervals indicated on the guide are for normal service.
For extreme conditions, high speed, heat, mud, snow, rough roads, dust,
etc., change engine oil and lubricate more frequently. In addition to
the items on the guide, brake, gear shifter, clutch control linkage,
and hinges must be lubricated at frequent intervals.</p>

<p><b>b. Supplies.</b> In the field it may not be possible
to supply a complete assortment of lubricants called for by the
Lubrication Guide to meet the recommendations. It will be necessary
to make the best use of those available, subject to inspection by the
officer concerned, in consultation with responsible ordnance personnel.</p>

<p><b>c. Lubrication Notes.</b> The following notes apply to the
Lubrication Guide &#40;<a href="#fig_10">fig. 10</a>&#41;. All note references in the guide itself
are to the steps below having the corresponding number:</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; <span class="smcap">Brake Fittings.</span> Exercise caution when lubricating brake
operating cams and front brake cover bushing, as excess grease working
out of these bearings is likely to get onto brake lining, reducing
brake efficiency. CAUTION: <i>When using air‐operated grease gun, make
sure not to overlubricate brake fittings</i>.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; <span class="smcap">Brake Hand Lever Oilcan Points.</span> Oil hand lever fittings
and “oiler” mounted on cable housing. Oil front brake control cable at
ends of control cable housing.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; <span class="smcap">Generator Commutator End Bearing.</span> Hand‐pack with general
purpose grease, No. 2, at temperatures above zero. Below zero, use
lighter grease. This operation requires removal of generator end cover.
Bearing outer grease retainer must be loosened and swung aside for
access to bearing. If not convenient to grease bearing at specified
intervals, at least lubricate with a few drops of engine oil applied
to hole in outer grease retainer. Do not overlubricate. CAUTION:
<i>Generator regulating brush plate must not be shifted while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a><br /><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span> bearing
outer grease retainer is loose &#40;par. <a href="#para_92">92</a>&#41;. Generator drive end bearing
requires no attention, since it is lubricated by oil circulating
through engine.</i></p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; <span class="smcap">Spark and Throttle Control Grips.</span> These grips require
disassembly. Twice a year, or whenever grips do not turn freely,
indicating need of lubrication, remove grips, clean parts, apply
grease, and reassemble &#40;par. <a href="#para_101">101</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; <span class="smcap">Air Cleaner.</span> Examine oil cup daily for excessive dirt and
correct oil level. Under extremely dusty or sandy conditions it may be
necessary to clean and refill the air cleaner more than once daily.
Refill oil cup to indicated level with engine oil. Drain, clean, and
refill oil cup every 250 miles, depending upon operating conditions.
Every 1,000 miles &#40;oftener if necessary&#41;, remove air cleaner filter
units, wash in dry‐cleaning solvent, lubricate, and reassemble &#40;par.
<a href="#para_76">76</a>&#41;. NOTE: <i>Early type round cleaner did not have removable filter
element. Complete cleaner must be removed to wash element.</i></p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; <span class="smcap">Wheel Bearings.</span> When wheel hubs are lubricated at regular
500‐mile interval, <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> ounce of grease with each greasing is sufficient.
This amounts to about 15 shots of the standard 1‐pound air gun, or four
strokes with a 1‐pound, hand‐operated gun. If vehicle has been operated
in water, wheel hubs submerged, apply hub greasing service immediately
afterward &#40;or soon as situation permits&#41;. Do not overlubricate wheel
hub bearings, as excess grease may work into brake linings, reducing
brake efficiency. When using air‐operated grease gun, it is easy to
overlubricate wheel hub bearings.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; <span class="smcap">Steering Head Bearings.</span> Every 50,000 miles, repack upper
and lower bearings, or whenever there is occasion to remove rigid fork
for repair or replacement &#40;par. <a href="#para_98">98</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;8&#41; <span class="smcap">Tank, Engine Oil.</span> Oil tank is located on right side of
motorcycle. Empty tank holds 1 U. S. gallon. Check daily and add engine
oil as necessary to refill tank within 1 inch of top. Oil level gage
rod &#40;dip stick&#41; is located directly below tank cap. When oil level is
down to “REFILL” mark on gage rod, 2 U. S. quarts may be added. Drain
oil tank every 1,000 miles and refill with fresh engine oil. Drain plug
located on underside of tank in forward position. In extremely dusty
service, and in winter weather, change oil oftener.</p>

<p>&#40;<i>a</i>&#41; <i>Winter Caution.</i> Water is a by‐product of combustion in any
internal combustion engine. In a condensed state, the water vapor
formed would equal approximately the quantity of gasoline burned. Some
of this water vapor escapes past the rings into the crankcase. When
starting and warming up in cold weather, considerable vapor getting
into crankcase condenses to water before crankcase is hot enough
to exhaust the vapor, without inside condensation, through outside
breather. If engine is driven enough to get crankcase thoroughly warmed
up frequently, most of this water is again vaporized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span> and blown out
through outside breather. However, a moderately driven engine, making
only short runs now and then, and seldom thoroughly warmed up, is
likely to accumulate an increasing amount of water in oil tank. This
water will, in freezing weather, become slush or ice and, if allowed
to accumulate too long, may block oil lines with resulting damage to
engine. Also, water mixed with oil for some time, forms a heavy sludge
of considerable acid content that is very harmful to bearings and
other internal engine parts. To sum it up briefly, an engine that is
used only for short runs during freezing weather requires frequent oil
changes along with thorough flushing of tank to remove any accumulated
sludge.</p>

<p>&#40;9&#41; <span class="smcap">Transmission Filler Opening.</span> Check oil level in
transmission case every 250 miles and add engine oil as necessary
to bring level up to filler opening. If motorcycle is run unusually
long distances, inspect more frequently. Motorcycle must be on rear
stand in straight upright position when checking oil level or filling
transmission case. Use same grade of oil used in engine, summer, and
winter. If gear shifting difficulty is caused by oil congealing in
extremely cold weather, thin oil with small amount of kerosene or
dry‐cleaning solvent. Every 1,000 miles, drain and refill transmission
to level of transmission filler plug opening with specified grade of
engine oil. Transmission holds &frac34; pint of oil. To drain transmission
case remove filler plug and lay motorcycle on right side. CAUTION: <i>Do
not leave motorcycle on side longer than two minutes</i>.</p>

<p id="para_20c_10">&#40;10&#41; <span class="smcap">Drive Chains.</span></p>

<p>&#40;<i>a</i>&#41; Front and rear drive chains are automatically supplied with
lubrication by engine oil pumps. Chain oilers are adjustable and may
need occasional readjustment to meet lubrication requirements of varied
operating conditions. Every 1,000 miles &#40;or more often if operating
conditions are extremely severe&#41; inspect front primary drive chain for
adequate lubrication &#40;<a href="#fig_36">fig. 36</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;<i>b</i>&#41; At every 1,000‐mile period rear drive chain should have
additional lubrication as follows: Remove chain, wash thoroughly in
dry‐cleaning solvent and hang it up to dry. Then soak chain in SAE 10
engine oil for a short period of time to allow oil to penetrate into
all chain bearings. Drain chain and wipe off excess oil. Install rear
chain &#40;par. <a href="#para_63">63</a>&#41;. &#40;This attention is not required by front chain.&#41;
Readjustment of chain oilers must be made only by organization mechanic
&#40;par. <a href="#para_61">61</a>&#41;. CAUTION: <i>Inspect frequently and make sure that rear chain
oiler supply pipe is clear, not bent or damaged</i>.</p>

<p><b>d. Before Applying Lubricant.</b> Always wipe dirt from the
lubrication fittings or plugs so that dirt will not enter with the
lubricant. Lubricate all chassis points after washing vehicle or after
vehicle has been operated in streams or extremely muddy or slushy
roads. CAUTION: <i>It is extremely important that high‐pressure cleaning
streams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span> or steam should not be directed against ends of wheel
hubs, brake side cover bearings, air cleaner, handle bar grips, or
electrical system. To do so will seriously affect correct lubrication
and functioning of these parts.</i></p>

<p><b>e. Oilcan Points.</b> All brake, transmission, and clutch
control points not fitted with grease connections should be lubricated
with engine oil. Front brake control cable, spark, and throttle
control wires must be oiled at the ends of their respective housings,
especially after washing vehicle, or after operating it in wet weather.
Keep battery terminal felt washers saturated with engine oil to prevent
corrosion of connections.</p>

<p><b>f. Warning Light.</b> Action of the engine oil feed pump
is indicated by red signal light in instrument panel. Rider must be
thoroughly familiar with operating characteristics of this signal
light, to judge condition of engine oil circulating system &#40;par. <a href="#para_7f">7 f</a>&#41;.</p>

<h4 id="para_26">26. SECOND ECHELON PREVENTIVE MAINTENANCE SERVICES.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Regular scheduled maintenance inspections and services are
a preventive maintenance function of the using arms, and are the
responsibility of commanders of operating organizations.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; <span class="smcap">Frequency.</span> The frequencies of the preventive maintenance
services outlined herein are considered a minimum requirement for
normal operation of vehicles. Under unusual operating conditions
such as extreme temperatures, and dusty or sandy terrain, it may be
necessary to perform certain maintenance services more frequently.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; <span class="smcap">First Echelon Participation.</span> The drivers should accompany
their vehicles and assist the mechanics while periodic second echelon
preventive maintenance services are performed. Ordinarily the driver
should present the vehicle for a scheduled preventive maintenance
service in a reasonably clean condition; that is, it should be dry,
and not caked with mud or grease to such an extent that inspection and
servicing will be seriously hampered. However, the vehicle should not
be washed or wiped thoroughly clean, since certain types of defects,
such as cracks, leaks, and loose or shifted parts or assemblies are
more evident if the surfaces are slightly soiled or dusty.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; If instructions other than those contained in the general
procedures in paragraph &#40;<a href="#general_procedures">4</a>&#41; or the specific procedures in paragraph &#40;<a href="#specific_procedures">5</a>&#41;
which follow, are required for the correct performance of a preventive
maintenance service, or for correction of a deficiency, other sections
of the vehicle operator’s manual pertaining to the item involved, or a
designated individual in authority, should be consulted.</p>

<p id="general_procedures">&#40;4&#41; <span class="smcap">General Procedures.</span> These general procedures are basic
instructions which are to be followed when performing the services
on the items listed in the specific procedures. The second echelon
personnel must be thoroughly trained in these procedures so that they
will apply them automatically.</p>

<p>&#40;<i>a</i>&#41; When new or overhauled subassemblies are installed to correct
deficiencies, care should be taken to see that they are clean,
correctly installed, properly lubricated, and adjusted.</p>

<p>&#40;<i>b</i>&#41; When installing new lubricant retainer seals, a coating of the
lubricant should be wiped over the sealing surface of the lip of the
seal.</p>

<p>&#40;<i>c</i>&#41; The general inspection of each item applies also to any
supporting member or connection, and usually includes a check to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
whether the item is in good condition, correctly assembled, secure,
or excessively worn. The mechanics must be thoroughly trained in the
following explanations of these terms:</p>

<p><i>1.</i> The inspection for “good condition” is usually an external visual
inspection to determine whether or not the unit is damaged beyond safe
or serviceable limits. The term “good condition” is explained further
by the following: not bent or twisted, not chafed or burned, not broken
or cracked, not bare or frayed, not dented or collapsed, not torn or
cut.</p>

<p><i>2.</i> The inspection of a unit to see that it is “correctly assembled”
is usually an external visual inspection to see whether or not it is in
its normal assembled position in the vehicle.</p>

<p><i>3.</i> The inspection of a unit to determine if it is “secure” is usually
an external visual examination, a hand‐feel, or a pry‐bar check for
looseness; such an inspection should include any brackets, lock
washers, lock nuts, locking wires, or cotter pins used in assembly.</p>

<p><i>4.</i> “Excessively worn” will be understood to mean worn, close to or
beyond serviceable limits, and likely to result in a failure if not
replaced before the next scheduled inspection.</p>

<p>&#40;<i>d</i>&#41; Special Services. These are indicated by repeating the item
numbers in the columns which show the interval at which the services
are to be performed, and show that the parts, or assemblies, are to
receive certain mandatory services. For example, an item number in
one or both columns opposite a <i>Tighten</i> procedure, means that the
actual tightening of the object must be performed. The special services
include:</p>

<p><i>1. Adjust.</i> Make all necessary adjustments in accordance with the
pertinent section of the vehicle operator’s manual, special bulletins,
or other current directives.</p>

<p><i>2. Clean.</i> Clean units of the vehicle with dry‐cleaning solvent to
remove excess lubricant, dirt, and other foreign material. After the
parts are cleaned, rinse them in clean dry‐cleaning solvent, and dry
them thoroughly. Take care to keep the parts clean until reassembled,
and be certain to keep dry‐cleaning solvent away from rubber or other
material which it will damage. Clean the protective grease coating from
new parts, since this material is not a good lubricant.</p>

<p><i>3. Special lubrication.</i> This applies both to lubrication operations
that do not appear on the vehicle Lubrication Guide, and to items
that do appear on such guides, but should be performed in connection
with the maintenance operations, if parts have to be disassembled for
inspection or service.</p>

<p><i>4. Serve.</i> This usually consists of performing special operations,
such as replenishing battery water, and draining and refilling units
with oil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p><i>5. Tighten.</i> All tightening operations should be performed with
sufficient wrench‐torque &#40;force on the wrench handle&#41; to tighten the
nut according to good mechanical practice. Use torque‐indicating
wrench where specified. Do not overtighten, as this may strip threads,

<p>&#40;<i>e</i>&#41; When conditions make it difficult to perform the complete
preventive maintenance procedures at one time, these can sometimes be
handled in sections, planning to complete all operations within the
task if possible. All available time at halts and in bivouac areas must
be utilized, if necessary, to assure that maintenance operations are
completed. When limited by the tactical situation, items with special
services in the columns should be given first consideration.</p>

<p>&#40;<i>f</i>&#41; The numbers of the preventive maintenance procedures that follow
are identical with those outlined on W.D. AGO Form No. 463, which
is the Preventive Maintenance Service Work Sheet for Motorcycles.
Certain items on the work sheet that do not apply to this vehicle
are not included in the procedures in this manual. In general, the
numerical sequence of items on the work sheet is followed in the manual
procedures, but in some instances there is deviation for conservation
of the mechanic’s time and effort.</p>

<p id="para_29b"><b>b. Tests to Determine Mechanical Condition of Engine.</b></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; <span class="smcap">Rings and Valves.</span> This is a simple compression test. If
possible, make this test with the engine warm. Ignition switch must
be off. Crank engine slowly, placing entire weight of body on starter
crank. Engine compression should sustain the weight of an average size
rider several seconds before crank passes through complete range of
its travel. If engine offers little resistance to starter crank in
testing either or both cylinders, it is an indication that compression
is not adequate in one or both cylinders. No clearance or insufficient
clearance at valve tappets; valves sticking in guides; valves seating
poorly; cylinder heads leaking; spark plugs loose in heads; piston
rings badly worn and/or broken; cylinder and pistons badly worn, or
lack of lubrication could cause the above condition. Make external
checks first: See that oil is in tank, that spark plugs are tight, and
examine around cylinder heads for signs of leaking oil deposits. In
extremely cold weather, resistance to the starter crank is increased by
“stiff” oil in engine and transmission. Therefore, do not mistake this
condition to indicate actual engine compression.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; <span class="smcap">Abnormal Engine Noise.</span> Owing to constructional design of
the motorcycle, correct adjustment of the several units and components
is necessary for smooth and normally quiet engine operation. Many
motorcycles have been “deadlined” and engines exchanged because
simple tune‐up service and correct adjustment of components have been
neglected. Rough, jerky, and noisy engine action at low speed riding
is usually caused by excessively loose front and rear drive chains,
or by a transmission being loose in its frame mounting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span> Fast idling
of engine with the front drive chain too loose, may give the false
impression that the engine bearings and pistons need replacement
service. Engine sprocket loose on its shaft will cause a pounding noise
similar to that of badly worn engine bearings. If front drive chain
is too tight, or engine sprocket and chain are badly worn, a grinding
noise results, seeming to come from the engine. Excessively loose valve
tappets will cause abnormal metallic noise in the valve timing gear
train and engine crankcase. Spark advanced too far will cause rough
engine performance at low speeds as well as spark knock, pounding,
and overheating. Engine pounding and rough operation with consequent
noise, result from loose mounting bolts. Generator mounted to give
insufficient gear‐tooth clearance will cause “howl” in gear case.</p>

<h4 id="para_30">30. ENGINE LUBRICATING SYSTEM.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Action of the oil feed pump is indicated by the red signal
light located in right side of instrument panel. &#40;Red signal light is
normally grounded by the oil pressure switch. When oil pump pressure
is built up several pounds, diaphragm opens the signal light circuit.&#41;
Action of the scavenger &#40;oil return&#41; pump is indicated &#40;engine running&#41;
by oil dripping from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>&ndash;inch hole in oil return tube &#40;large tube&#41; inside
oil tank, just back of oil gage rod &#40;dip stick&#41; tube. Since the oil
feed pump and scavenger pump are separate units, operated individually,
it is possible &#40;due to faulty unit&#41; for either to function alone, thus
affecting engine oil pressure and return of oil to the tank. Action
of the vent pipe &#40;small pipe&#41; located within the oil tank is of a
“breather” nature; its function not being indicated in any manner.
Before attempting to diagnose trouble in engine lubricating system,
rider must be familiar with and understand indications by instrument
panel signal lights &#40;par. <a href="#para_7f">7 <b>f</b></a>&#41;.</p>

<p><b>b. Red Signal Light Fails to Burn When Ignition and Light
Switch is Turned On.</b></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Check other lights to determine if battery is “up” and that switch
and wiring connections between battery and switch are in good order.
See that wire connection is secure and screw is tight on oil pressure
switch terminal. Failure of light to burn after these checks indicates
that either the lamp is burned out or oil pressure switch is faulty.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Test to eliminate the oil pressure switch by removing wire from
switch terminal; ground wire on switch body and note if red light burns
with ignition and light switch in “ON” position. If light burns, it
indicates that oil pressure switch is faulty, and must be replaced.
If light does not burn in making this test, it indicates that lamp is
burned out. Remove panel cover &#40;par. <a href="#para_119">119</a>&#41; and replace lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p><b>c. Red Signal Light Continues to Burn After Engine Is
Operated Above Idling Speeds.</b></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Check oil supply in tank. If light fails to go out after engine
is warm, or after 1 minute of operation, further checks must be made
to locate trouble, as indication points to faulty engine lubrication
system, or fault in signal circuit. Eliminate the signal system first.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Test oil pressure signal switch to panel signal light circuit.
Remove wire from oil pressure switch terminal by turning on ignition
and light switch and observing red signal light. If light burns, short
circuit in wiring exists. If light does not burn, it indicates normal
condition, leaving oil pressure switch of the signal circuit to be
tested.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Install new oil pressure switch and start engine. If red signal
light goes out after engine is operated above idling speeds, it
indicates trouble in oil pressure signal switch. If red signal light
continues to burn, it indicates trouble in oil feed pump. Replace pump
&#40;par. <a href="#para_44">44</a>&#41;.</p>

<p><b>d. Excessive Smoke Issues from Exhaust and Oil Spray Issues
from Gear Case Breather Outlet.</b> This is an indication that the
scavenger pump is not draining engine crankcase and returning oil to
tank. With engine running at idle speed, examine oil return in tank.
Remove tank oil cap, and with a small flashlight &#40;tactical situation
permitting&#41;, observe whether or not oil is dripping from <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>&ndash;inch hole
in oil return tube. Hole is on under side of tube and is located just
back of oil gage rod tube. If observation is poor, place finger over
hole and feel for pulsation of oil pressure. If oil does not return to
tank, scavenger pump is faulty. Should the crankcase breather valve
be incorrectly timed, smoke will issue from the exhaust, but not as
noticeably as when scavenger pump is not working. Refer to step e below
for this condition.</p>

<p><b>e. Smoke Issues from Exhaust and Excessive Oil Condition Exists
Around Cylinder Exhaust Ports</b> &#40;<b>where exhaust pipes enter
cylinders</b>&#41;. Engine scavenger pump and crankcase breather valve are
one unit, operated by worm gear located behind engine shaft pinion
gear. Although scavenger pump is not “timed,” the breather valve sleeve
which drives it must be timed to balance the engine lubricating system.
If for any reason the scavenger pump unit is removed from engine base,
the breather valve must be retimed &#40;within the gear case&#41; when pump
assembly is replaced. Incorrectly timed breather valve will force oil
past piston rings, causing some smoke, besides forcing oil out through
exhaust ports, causing excessive oily condition around exhaust pipes
where they enter cylinder ports.</p>

<h4 id="para_31">31. FUEL SYSTEM.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Many symptoms which might be attributed to the air‐fuel
system are, in reality, due to faulty ignition. Before attempting any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
but the obviously required adjustments, check the ignition system
thoroughly. Gasoline tank supply valve is a dual purpose valve, and its
operation is explained in paragraph <a href="#para_5b">5 <b>b</b></a>.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> Shut off gasoline supply valve. Disconnect fuel line at
strainer, open valve, and observe free flow of fuel from pipe. If line
is plugged, remove, clean out, and replace.</p>

<p><b>c.</b> Remove, disassemble, clean, and install fuel strainer &#40;par.
<a href="#para_72">72</a>&#41;.</p>

<p><b>d. Hard Starting, Spitting, and Misfiring Caused by Water
in Fuel.</b> Remove drain screw from carburetor bowl, drain bowl,
and replace screw. Take care not to cross drain screw threads when

matter after bowl is drained, replace carburetor &#40;pars. <a href="#para_70">70</a> and <a href="#para_71">71</a>&#41;.
Remove air cleaner oil cup and inspect for evidence of water in oil.
Drain, clean, refill to correct level mark, and replace cup. Should
above procedure fail to eliminate trouble, drain fuel tank by removing
drain plug located under tank in forward position. Replace drain plug
and refill tank with fuel.</p>

<p><b>e. Hard Starting, or Missing at Idling and Low Speeds.</b>
Carburetor low speed circuit in need of adjustment &#40;par. <a href="#para_68">68</a>&#41;.
Carburetor high speed circuit is controlled by a fixed jet.</p>

<p><b>f. Impossible to Obtain Satisfactory Carburetor Adjustment:
Lean Spot Between Idling and Up to 30 Miles per Hour Speeds.</b>
Carburetors in service for some time become dirty and crust forms
in the throttle barrel, making satisfactory low speed adjustment
difficult, if not impossible. Replace carburetor &#40;pars. <a href="#para_70">70</a> and <a href="#para_71">71</a>&#41;.</p>

off adequate air supply to carburetor. Check the oil cup level. If oil
cup level is correct, remove, clean, and install cleaner elements &#40;par.
<a href="#para_76">76</a>&#41;.</p>

<h4 id="para_32">32. IGNITION SYSTEM.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> When checking ignition system for trouble, make the most
obvious and simple checks first. For example: Turn on ignition and
light switch, observe lights to ascertain battery current supply; then
check to see that current is reaching spark coil, circuit breaker, etc.
Faulty spark plugs are responsible for the great majority of engine
ignition troubles. There is no service for spark plugs other than
sandblast cleaning and correct adjustment of electrodes. Questionable
spark plugs must be replaced &#40;par. <a href="#para_83">83</a>&#41;.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> Remedy all poor connections in ignition wiring system &#40;
<a href="#fig_48">fig. 48</a>&#41;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<p><b>c.</b> Remove circuit breaker cover, operate engine with starter
pedal, and observe opening and closing of circuit breaker points.
Correct point gap when breaker lever fiber is on highest point of cam
is 0.022 inch. For adjustment refer to paragraph <a href="#para_84">84</a>.</p>

<p><b>d. Testing for High Tension Spark.</b> Spark at plug gaps
depends upon condition and operation of circuit breaker points,
condition of condenser, and condition of spark coil and high‐tension
cables. Testing the ignition system is best done by means of
elimination, testing each unit by replacement until trouble is located;
then replacing serviceable units which were removed.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Remove spark plug cable terminal from either plug, leaving other
cable and plug connected &#40;to effect ground return of high‐tension
current&#41;; turn engine until circuit breaker points are closed; turn
ignition and light switch on; hold high tension cable terminal &frac14; inch
from cylinder; open and close circuit breaker points with finger and
observe spark jump at gap. If spark jumps gap, it indicates ignition
primary and secondary circuits are complete.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; No spark at high‐tension gap calls for testing of primary and
secondary circuits. Turn engine until breaker points are held open;
hold cable end &frac14; inch from cylinder; turn ignition switch on and with
the bit of a screwdriver, make a good ground connection between breaker
movable &#40;lever&#41; point, and the ground. If a good spark is obtained
at high‐tension cable terminal gap when ground connection made by
screwdriver is broken, clean or replace faulty breaker points &#40;par. <a href="#para_84">84</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; If circuit breaker points are in good condition, but no spark &#40;or
a very weak spark&#41; occurs at high‐tension gap, replace condenser &#40;par.
<a href="#para_85">85</a>&#41; and repeat test under step &#40;1&#41; above. If replacement of condenser
does not remedy trouble, replace spark coil &#40;par. <a href="#para_89">89</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; If tests made under steps d &#40;1&#41;, &#40;2&#41;, and &#40;3&#41; above show ignition
system to be in good order &#40;no units having been replaced&#41;, and
ignition trouble still exists, it means that breaker points, condenser,
and spark coil must be replaced with new units and engine road test
made with each replacement until trouble has been located and remedied.</p>

<p><b>e. Ignition System Tests Satisfactory but Engine Starts Hard,
Overheats or Misses.</b> Clearly an indication that spark plugs are
faulty. Remove spark plugs, clean with sandblast, regap points between
0.028 inch to 0.030 inch and reinstall. Replace defective plugs with
new ones of correct &#40;No. 2&#41; heat range &#40;par. <a href="#para_83">83</a>&#41;.</p>

<p><b>f. Engine Misses After Warm‐up, or When Quite Hot.</b>
Replacement of spark plugs should remedy this trouble. If it does not,
then either the condenser or spark coil is at fault. Replace condenser
first &#40;par. <a href="#para_85">85</a>&#41;. If new condenser fails to correct trouble, replace
spark coil &#40;par. <a href="#para_89">89</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Remove cylinder head bolts, using head bolt wrench 41&ndash;W&ndash;1525. NOTE:
<i>On some 42 WLA models, plain washers &#40;0.095&ndash;inch thick&#41;, in addition
to regular &#40;heavy&#41; cylinder head bolt washers, were used to prevent
cylinder head bolts from bottoming.</i></p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; Perform carbon removal &#40;head only&#41;. Refer to paragraph <a href="#para_42">42</a>.</p>

<p><b>b. Installing Gasket and Head</b> &#40;<a href="#fig_15">fig. 15</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Clean top of cylinder. Apply a light application of grease or oil
to both sides of gasket before locating on cylinder head. Place head on
cylinder.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Install head bolts, using heavy washers &#40;also 0.095&ndash;inch thick
plain washers, if any were removed&#41;. If in doubt as to use of
0.095&ndash;inch thick washers in addition to regular washers, measure depth
of bolt holes in cylinder head. Head having hole depth of 31/32 inch
must use the 0.095&ndash;inch thick washers in addition to regular washers.
Head having bolt hole depth of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch does not require the
0.095&ndash;inch thick washers.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Install cylinder frame bracket with the two long bolts, special
&#40;spool‐shaped&#41; spacers, and flat washers. The spacers go between
cylinder heads and frame bracket. A flat washer goes under the head of
each long cylinder bolt, above the bracket; some engines may have flat
washers between the spacers and the bracket.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Tighten head bolts evenly to ensure a tight cylinder head joint.
Use head bolt wrench 41&ndash;W&ndash;1525, first turning down bolts just snug,
then tightening each bolt <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> to &frac14; turn at a time, until all are securely
tightened. If torque wrench is available, tighten head bolts to 60
foot‐pounds minimum, 65 foot‐pounds maximum tension when engine is cold.</p>

oil feed pipe from oil pump nipple.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Oil pump is secured to engine gear case cover by one hexagon head
bolt and three nuts. Two of the nuts are extra long to provide wrench
clearance, and their location should be noted so they will be put back
where they belong when reinstalling pump. After removing screw and
nuts, remove pump. Unless a new pump gasket is available, take care
not to damage or break the old one, as this is a very special gasket
concerning both thickness and holes provided for oil channels. A
“homemade” gasket may put oiling system completely out of commission.</p>

<p><b>b. Installing Oil Pump.</b></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Clean surface of pump body mounting on gear case cover and see that
gasket is in good condition. Clean face of oil pump body.</p>

<h4 id="para_47">47. DESCRIPTION &#40;<a href="#fig_21">fig. 21</a>&#41;.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Clutch is of simple multiple‐dry‐disk type, having two steel
disks and three lined disks, one of which provides spring action within
disk pack to “cushion” clutch operation.</p>

<h4 id="para_48">48. MAINTENANCE AND ADJUSTMENT &#40;figs. <a href="#fig_22">22</a>, <a href="#fig_23">23</a>, <a href="#fig_25">24</a>, and <a href="#fig_25">25</a>&#41;.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> If clutch adjustment is correctly maintained, clutch will
cause very little trouble. Ease of gear shifting and service life
of transmission gear shifter clutch dogs depend largely upon full
disengagement of the clutch. Clutch adjustment is in two parts; namely,
control linkage and spring tension. Do not adjust clutch spring tension
before correcting control adjustment.</p>

<p><b>b. Clutch Control Linkage</b> &#40;<a href="#fig_22">fig. 22</a>&#41;. Operation of foot
pedal, control cable, and clutch release lever actuates the push rod
through hollow transmission shaft, disengaging or engaging clutch at
will. Correct adjustment to control cable and release lever must be
made before push rod adjustment is made.</p>

<p><b>c. Clutch Control Adjustment</b> &#40;figs. <a href="#fig_23">23</a>, <a href="#fig_24">24</a>, <a href="#fig_25">25</a>, and <a href="#fig_26">26</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; <span class="smcap">Adjusting Cable Length.</span> With clutch in fully disengaged
position &#40;foot pedal heel down&#41; the clutch release lever must clear the
countershaft sprocket cover stud and/or nut by <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> inch. Should clutch
release lever strike sprocket cover and nut, clutch push rod movement
is restricted, and clutch cannot be fully disengaged. Length of control
cable must be adjusted to obtain <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&ndash;inch clutch release lever and
sprocket cover stud and/or nut clearance. To lengthen or shorten clutch
control cable, cable adjustable end must be removed from foot pedal
stud &#40;figs. <a href="#fig_23">23</a> and <a href="#fig_24">24</a>&#41;. With foot pedal in forward &#40;toe down&#41; position,
remove cotter pin and washer retaining cable end. Release other end
of cable from notch in clutch release lever by pressing release lever
inward and lifting cable end out of notch. Rock the foot pedal to rear
&#40;heel down&#41; position and work cable adjustable end off foot pedal stud.
Loosen lock nut and turn cable end to right &#40;clockwise&#41; to shorten
cable; turn to left &#40;counter‐clockwise&#41; to lengthen cable. Tighten
lock nut, install cable end on foot pedal stud; install washer and
cotter pin, and install other end of cable in clutch release lever
notch.</p>

lever notch &#40;<a href="#fig_25">fig. 25</a>&#41;. This free play ensures a fully engaged clutch
without pressure on clutch release bearing. Adjustment is made by means
of push rod adjusting screw located in clutch outer disk. Remove two
screws which secure inspection hole cover to chain guard &#40;<a href="#fig_25">fig. 25</a>&#41;. If
clutch release lever has less than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub>&ndash;inch free play at end of cable,
loosen push rod adjusting screw lock nut and turn push rod adjusting
screw to the left &#40;counter‐clockwise&#41; to increase amount of free play.
If clutch release lever has more than &frac14;&ndash;inch free play at end of cable,
turn adjusting screw to the right &#40;clockwise&#41; to decrease amount of
free play. Tighten lock nut after correct adjustment is obtained.
Replace inspection hole cover. CAUTION: <i>If end of clutch release
lever has no free play as explained above, clutch will not hold when
fully engaged. If too much free play is allowed, clutch will drag when
disengaged; consequently, transmission gears will shift hard, clash,
and eventually become damaged.</i></p>

<p><b>c. Oil‐soaked Disk Liners.</b> If lined disks are not badly
worn, but are oil‐soaked, wash them thoroughly in clean gasoline and
dry with air or heat.</p>

<p><b>d. Shrunken or Weak Springs.</b> If clutch has been badly
overheated as a result of slippage, springs may be found in shrunken or
weakened condition. Assuming disk liners are not badly worn, weakened
springs are indicated when the three spring tension nuts have been
tightened to make the clutch hold until the distance between spring
collar and releasing &#40;outer&#41; disk is ⅞ inch. If shrunken or weak
springs are suspected, remove them for inspection.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; To remove springs, remove push rod adjusting screw lock nut,
freeing spring collar and the 10 springs from the releasing &#40;outer&#41;
disk assembly.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Measure springs for free length. Free length of new clutch springs
is approximately 1&frac12; inches &#40;they may vary plus or minus 1/32 inch&#41;.
Old springs found to be shrunk <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch &#40;total free length of spring
is 1⅜ inch or less&#41; must be replaced with new springs. NOTE: <i>Before
replacing springs, select 10 springs that do not vary more than 1/32
inch to make up the assembly.</i></p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; <span class="smcap">Assembling Releasing Disk, Springs, and Spring Collar.</span>
Place the 10 springs upright on releasing disk to centrally locate each
of the 10 stud holes. Place spring collar &#40;flanged edge down&#41; over ends
of springs, locating the collar plate “dimples” in ends of 7 of the
springs. Place the large washer over push rod adjusting screw; tighten
adjusting screw nut, and compress springs lightly. Turn assembly over
and observe alinement of springs and disk holes. If necessary, insert a
⅜&ndash;inch rod through holes to aline springs. Tighten down adjusting screw
nut; assembly is now ready for complete clutch assembly.</p>

<p class="p1" id="para_51a"><b>a</b>. It is important when assembling a clutch to start with a
lined disk. Install the two steel disks so that the antirattle devices
are staggered on splines in the shell, and the “sprung” disk &#40;lined
on one side&#41; is the last of the pack, its lined side facing the steel
disk. Before installing disks, see that bearing retaining plate lock
rings &#40;“R,” <a href="#fig_21">fig. 21</a>&#41; are in place on the short studs, and are tight
against the retaining plate. This is to prevent noise in the clutch.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Install one of the two lined disks on clutch hub studs first.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Next, engage one of the two steel disks with the splines within the
clutch shell, with side stamped “OUT” facing outward.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Install the remaining lined disk on the clutch hub studs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Engage remaining steel disk with shell splines with “OUT” side
facing outward.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Install “sprung” &#40;one side lined&#41; steel disk, lined side inward, on
clutch hub studs.</p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; It will be noted that the three long, threaded‐end, clutch hub
studs are not spaced an equal distance apart. It will also be noted
that the three holes &#40;keyhole shaped&#41; in the spring collar are not
spaced equidistantly. Therefore, when installing releasing disk and
spring assembly on clutch hub studs, the three threaded studs and holes
in spring collar must be alined. Install assembly on studs, replace
the three nut locks, replace the three adjusting nuts, and tighten all
three evenly until the distance between shoulder of spring collar and
face of releasing disk is 1&ndash;1/32 inch &#40;<a href="#fig_27">fig. 27</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Remove the large washer and replace push rod adjusting screw lock
nut. Do not attempt adjustment of clutch release lever and push rod
adjusting screw until outer front chain guard and footboard have been
installed.</p>

<h4 id="para_53">53. DESCRIPTION.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Transmission has three speeds: low, second, and high, and
is of the constant‐mesh, non‐selective type. High gear is direct
drive. Since “dogs” on gear shifter clutches are used to engage
transmission gears, it is of great importance that vehicle clutch is
correctly adjusted. Clutch must be fully disengaged when shifting
gears, to prevent clashing of gears, and possible damage to the shifter
clutch “dogs” and transmission gears. It is also important that gear
shifter control linkage be kept in correct adjustment to ensure full
engagement of shifter clutch driving dogs in all positions, thus
preventing possible damage caused by dogs jumping out of engagement
under driving load. Close fitting and needle roller bearings, within
the transmission, necessitate use of engine oil &#40;seasonal grade&#41; in
transmission case for adequate lubrication.</p>

<h4 id="para_54">54. CONTROL LINKAGE &#40;<a href="#fig_32">fig. 32</a>&#41;.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a. Transmission Shifted to Adjust Front Drive Chain.</b> The
transmission is located to receive power from front &#40;engine&#41; drive
chain and transmit power through rear drive chain to rear wheel, and
is movable on its mounting for adjustment of the front &#40;engine&#41; drive
chain. When front &#40;engine&#41; drive chain is adjusted, transmission gear
shifter control linkage is affected. Therefore, after each front drive
chain adjustment, gear shifter control linkage must be checked, and, if
necessary, correctly adjusted to ensure proper gear shifting with full
engagement of the gear shifter clutch driving “dogs” as well as prevent
transmission from jumping out of gear under load.</p>

<p><b>b. Checking Gear Shifter Control Linkage.</b> Before making
adjustment to gear shifter control linkage, make the following checks:
See that all linkage points from transmission gear shifter lever to
gear shifter hand lever are well oiled and free‐working. Check hand
lever pivot bolt nut for tightness. Observe whether there is binding
or interference with shifter rod at any point in the shifting range;
this sometimes results from a bent snifter rod. Check whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span> or not
shifter rod is correctly adjusted so that when hand lever is moved to
any gear position in tank shifter guide, transmission lever moves to
the proper position to fully engage shifter clutch dogs and shifter cam
spring plunger in cam‐locating notch &#40;inside transmission&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Remove nut and bolt to disconnect shifter rod from hand lever.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; With slight backward and forward movement of shifter rod, carefully
“feel” transmission lever into exact position where shifter cam spring
plunger &#40;inside transmission&#41; seats fully in cam‐locating notch.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Next, see that hand lever is in exact “N” &#40;neutral&#41; position in

<p><b>c.</b> At position of least slack, a correctly adjusted rear
chain has &frac12;&ndash;inch, or slightly more, free up‐and‐down movement midway
between sprockets. Chain must never be run taut &#40;no slack at tightest
point&#41;. Chain must never be allowed to run loose enough to cause jerky
operation and/or strike the chain guard or other chassis parts.</p>

<p><b>d.</b> At the time rear chain adjustment is made, inspect chain for
correct lubrication and if necessary, adjust rear chain oiler &#40;par. <a href="#para_61">61</a>&#41;.</p>

<p><b>e.</b> Rear chain adjustment and rear wheel alinement are both made
by means of the rear wheel adjusting screws. Therefore, adjustment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span> of
either the chain or the wheel alinement can affect adjustment of the
other, making it necessary to consider both adjustments at the same
time.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Remove rear axle nut and lock washer &#40;right side of vehicle&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Loosen brake sleeve nut enough to allow brake assembly to slide
backward or forward in frame mounting &#40;<a href="#fig_39">fig. 39</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Loosen the two &#40;right and left side&#41; rear wheel adjusting screw
lock nuts.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Turn wheel adjusting screws clockwise &#40;to right&#41; to move wheel and
sprocket backward. This tightens chain. NOTE: <i>If chain is too tight,
turn wheel adjusting screws counterclockwise &#40;to left&#41; so that wheel
can be shifted forward. This will loosen chain.</i> Always turn the two
wheel adjusting screws an equal number of turns in order to keep wheel
alined.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Check correct alinement of wheel by noting that tire &#40;not tire
rim&#41; runs approximately midway between lower rear frame tubes at the
point where tubes join transmission mounting. It is desirable to have
tire run slightly closer &#40;not more than <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub> in.&#41; to right than to
left side lower tube. A further check of alinement is observing that
rear sprocket runs centrally in chain. CAUTION: <i>If rear wheel is not
correctly alined, vehicle steering will be affected, and sprockets will
wear excessively on one side.</i></p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; With adjustment of chain and wheel alinement completed, securely
tighten wheel adjusting screw lock nuts, and brake sleeve nut: replace
axle lock washer and nut, tightening nut.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Recheck adjustment of chain as tightening brake sleeve nut and axle
nut sometimes changes the chain adjustment.</p>

<p>&#40;8&#41; After tightening rear chain, rear brake may be found too tight.

<h4 id="para_61">61. CHAIN OILERS &#40;<a href="#fig_40">fig. 40</a>&#41;.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Both front and rear chains are automatically lubricated by
engine oil pumps. Chain oilers are adjustable and may need occasional
readjustment to meet lubrication requirements of varied operating

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Carburetor is of the side‐outlet, plain‐tube type with a
fixed venturi. Fuel feed is by gravity from tank above. Carburetor
has two manual controls: the throttle, which is operated by the right
handle bar grip, and the choke, which is operated by a lever on the
carburetor itself. The high speed fuel supply is governed by a fixed
&#40;non‐adjustable&#41; jet. The idling to medium speed &#40;30 mph&#41; fuel supply
is governed by an adjustable &#40;low speed&#41; needle valve located on rear
side of carburetor body.</p>

<h4 id="para_68">68. CARBURETOR ADJUSTMENT &#40;<a href="#fig_43">fig. 43</a>&#41;.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Before attempting to adjust carburetor to correct faulty
engine performance, attention should be given other items which have
a direct bearing on and can affect carburetor adjustment as well as
engine performance.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Inspect fuel tank cap and make sure air vent is not plugged.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; See that throttle control adjustment is correct &#40;par. <a href="#para_69">69</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; See that spark control adjustment is correct &#40;par. <a href="#para_88">88</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Drain and flush carburetor bowl &#40;par. <a href="#para_73">73</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Drain and flush fuel strainer &#40;par. <a href="#para_72">72</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; Inspect air cleaner to see that passage of air through cleaner
is not restricted by oil level being too high in oil cup, or by an
excessive accumulation of dirt in filter elements &#40;par. <a href="#para_76">76</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Check manifold packing nuts and carburetor mounting screws for
tightness.</p>

<p>&#40;8&#41; See that spark plugs are clean and that gaps are adjusted between
0.025 inch to 0.030 inch. If condition of spark plugs is questionable,
install new ones.</p>

<p>&#40;9&#41; Check adjustment of valve tappets &#40;par. <a href="#para_43">43</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;10&#41; Check compression of both cylinders &#40;par. <a href="#para_29b">29 b</a>.&#41; &#40;1&#41;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span></p>

<p>&#40;11&#41; Check condition and adjustment of circuit breaker points &#40;par. <a href="#para_84">84</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;12&#41; Check ignition to battery wiring connections &#40;diagram <a href="#fig_48">fig. 48</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;13&#41; See that battery is not entirely discharged by turning on lights
&#40;tactical situation permitting&#41; and observing brilliancy.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> A carburetor, once correctly adjusted, should require little,
if any, readjusting. At most, it should not be necessary to adjust the
low speed needle more than one or two notches either way to correct
mixture to meet changes in weather conditions.</p>

<p><b>c. Low Speed Adjusting Needle</b> &#40;figs. <a href="#fig_43">43</a> and <a href="#fig_44">44</a>&#41;.
Adjustment of this needle valve controls only idling and low speed
&#40;up to approximately 30 mph&#41; fuel mixture. Turn needle valve down &#40;to
right&#41; to make mixture leaner. Back out &#40;to left&#41; needle valve to make
mixture richer. Needle valve is held in any desired position by a
spring‐and‐ball plunger which engages notches in the needle adjusting
screw.</p>

<p><b>d. Complete Readjustment of Carburetor.</b> A carburetor that
is badly out of adjustment, and/or a new carburetor just installed,
must be adjusted as follows:</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Turn the low speed needle valve all the way down &#40;to right&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Back needle valve out &#40;to left&#41; about three full turns. With needle
valve in this position, engine will start, but mixture will probably be
too rich.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Start engine as follows: After choke lever has been moved to normal
open running position and engine is normally hot, correct adjustment
of needle valve by turning needle valve down &#40;to right&#41; one notch at a
time until mixture becomes so lean that engine misses, and is inclined
to stop: then back out &#40;to left&#41; needle valve 5 to 10 notches, or until
engine fires regularly with spark advanced and throttle closed &#40;or as
nearly closed as it can be set and still have engine running at idling
speed&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Adjust throttle lever stop screw &#40;<a href="#fig_43">fig. 43</a>&#41; as necessary to make
engine idle at proper speed with throttle in fully closed position.
Turning stop screw to the right makes engine idle faster. Turning stop
screw to the left makes engine idle slower. Do not idle engine at the
slowest possible speed, because an extremely slow idling adjustment
causes hard engine starting. Changing idling speed with throttle stop
screw is likely to change the low speed fuel mixture to some extent:
therefore, it will be necessary to again check and correct the low
speed needle valve adjustment &#40;step &#40;3&#41; above&#41;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Engine starting and all‐round carburetion will be improved with low
speed fuel adjustment slightly rich, rather than extremely lean.</p>

<p class="p1"><b>a. Intake System.</b> The air intake system consists of oil
bath air cleaner, connecting air hose, and carburetor intake hose
fitting. This system is located on left side of vehicle.</p>

<p><b>b. Exhaust System.</b> The exhaust system consists of muffler
and tailpiece assembly, front exhaust pipe assembly, and rear exhaust
pipe. Exhaust pipe ends are a slip fit in cylinder exhaust ports.</p>

<h4 id="para_76">76. AIR CLEANER &#40;figs. <a href="#fig_46">46</a> and <a href="#fig_47">47</a>&#41;.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a. General.</b> Air cleaner should not be submerged in water,
nor should high‐pressure stream be directed into cleaner louvers &#40;where
air enters on rear of body&#41; when cleaning vehicle. Either water or dirt
entering air cleaner in excessive quantities will raise the oil level
in oil cup and choke off proper air supply to carburetor.</p>

<p><b>b. Service.</b> With vehicle in normal use on hard‐surfaced
roads, clean and refill air cleaner oil cup with engine oil &#40;seasonal
grade&#41; at least each time engine oil tank is drained and refilled.
CAUTION: <i>Service more frequently under dusty conditions; daily under
extremely dusty conditions. Check oil supply daily.</i></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Hold oil cup with one hand and release &#40;unlatch&#41; oil cup retaining
spring clips to remove oil cup.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; If oil in cup is clean, with no signs of dirt and grit in oil or
cup, but the oil level is below the indicated level mark, add engine
oil &#40;seasonal grade&#41; to bring level up to mark. NOTE: <i>If oil and cup
are dirty, empty out oil and wash out cup with dry‐cleaning solvent.
Refill with clean engine oil &#40;seasonal grade&#41; to indicated level mark.</i></p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Before installing oil cup make sure that the oil cup gasket is in
place and in good condition.</p>

<i>Figure 46—Air Cleaner Oil Cup Removed</i></p></div>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Install oil cup, making sure that retaining spring clips are fully
engaged in lip of oil cup and hold oil cup securely to cleaner body.</p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; Oil bath air cleaners on earlier models are of “round” type, oil
cup being secured to body with a metal clamp band and thumb screw. When
oil cup is removed on this type of cleaner, the baffle plate will come
out with the cup. Make sure that baffle plate is correctly installed
and that gasket is in place when installing cup.</p>

<p><b>c. Maintenance</b> &#40;<a href="#fig_47">fig. 47</a>&#41;. The rectangular‐type oil bath
air cleaner is provided with two filter elements, retained in filter
body by means of the baffle plate. If daily check reveals excessive
accumulation of dirt and grit in oil and cup, filter elements must be
removed and cleaned. NOTE: <i>Check several times daily under extremely
dusty or sandy conditions.</i></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Hold oil cup with one hand and release &#40;unlatch&#41; oil cup retaining
spring clips; remove cup.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Unscrew baffle plate thumb screw and remove baffle plate.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Filter elements may “bind” in cleaner body. If so, rap side of body
with hand to loosen them; or, if necessary, withdraw elements from body
with pliers or a hooked wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Check for presence and condition of gasket above the two filter

<p>&#40;5&#41; Clean both filter elements thoroughly in dry‐cleaning solvent.
Allow elements to dry out &#40;use air hose if available&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; Clean oil cup and refill to indicated level mark. Use clean engine
oil &#40;seasonal grade&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Dip one screen surface of each filter element about &frac12; inch into
oil in the oil cup &#40;to “oil wet” filter pack&#41;. Install the two filter
elements, baffle plate, and oil cup immediately after “oil wetting” the
filter elements. Make sure gaskets are in place. NOTE: <i>Do not add more
oil to oil cup after elements have been dipped into it, because excess
oil absorbed by elements will drip back into oil cup, bringing level
back to normal.</i></p>

<p>&#40;8&#41; Round‐type oil bath air cleaner used on earlier models does not
have removable filter element. Complete cleaner body must be removed
from vehicle, immersed and agitated in cleaning solvent to wash out
dirt. After cleaning, allow filter element to dry &#40;use air hose if
available&#41;, then apply a few squirts of engine oil to inside of cleaner
element, using oilcan. Refill cup, replace baffle plate and cup,
securely tightening clamp band thumb screw.</p>

<h4 id="para_82">82. DESCRIPTION.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> The ignition system differs from that of the conventional
automotive types in that it has no distributor. A circuit breaker alone
is used. Both coil high‐tension winding ends lead directly to both
spark plugs. Thus both plugs spark at the same time, one cylinder being
on compression stroke while the other cylinder is on exhaust stroke.</p>

<h4 id="para_83">83. SPARK PLUGS.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Defective spark plugs are indicated by engine missing,
overheating, knocking excessively, and lacking normal power.</p>

<p><b>b. Type.</b> Spark plugs are medium heat range,
manufacturer’s &#40;H&ndash;D&#41; No. 3.</p>

<p><b>c. Cleaning.</b> Do not take plugs apart for cleaning. Use
the sandblast cleaner method.</p>

<p><b>d. Point Adjustment.</b> Bend electrode located in plug base
to adjust point gap 0.025 inch to 0.030 inch.</p>

<p><b>e. Replacement.</b> Use spark plug wrench &#40;41&ndash;W&ndash;3334&#41; to
install plugs, using new gaskets. Never draw a cool plug up tight in
a hot cylinder head, rather turn down snug and wait l/2 minute until
plug base is warm: then tighten securely. CAUTION: <i>Take care not to
cross‐thread when installing spark plug.</i></p>

<h4 id="para_84">84. CIRCUIT BREAKER POINTS &#40;<a href="#fig_49">fig. 49</a>&#41;.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Circuit breaker lever is insulated from ground and connects
to primary wire binding post by means of a “pig‐tail” wire. Stationary
point is grounded to timer base and is movable in order to adjust
circuit breaker points. Circuit breaker points that are burned or
pitted should be renewed or dressed with a clean fine‐cut, contact
point file. The file should not be used on other metals and should
not be allowed to become greasy or dirty. CAUTION: <i>Never use emery</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
<i>cloth to clean points.</i> Contact surfaces, after considerable use, may
not appear bright and smooth, but this is not necessarily an indication
that they are not functioning satisfactorily.</p>

<p><b>b. Remove Breaker Lever.</b></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; To disconnect condenser terminal, remove nut from end of condenser
and remove gear‐toothed washer, plain washer, and the brass terminal
strip. Do not remove fiber washer and plain washer located back of
brass terminal strip on condenser terminal post.</p>

Install flat washer, gear‐toothed washer, and nut.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Install breaker lever on pivot post insulated bearing.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Install breaker lever spring. Make sure that ends of spring are
retained correctly.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; NOTE: <i>Keep breaker lever cam very lightly greased.</i></p>

<p id="para_84f"><b>f. Adjusting Circuit Breaker Points</b> &#40;<a href="#fig_51">fig. 51</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Correct point gap is 0.022 inch. Circuit breaker point faces must
seat squarely against each other. If bent, square up and aline by
bending contact plate. Turn timer breaker cam until breaker lever fiber
is located on highest point of cam.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; With the adjustable point lock screws loose, shift the adjustable
point plate to obtain a 0.022&ndash;inch gap between the circuit breaker
points. Measure gap with an accurate thickness gage before retightening
lock screws, and again recheck point gap after tightening the lock
screws. NOTE: <i>Wrong circuit breaker point gap affects ignition timing.</i></p>

<h4 id="para_85">85. CONDENSER.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> The condenser is connected in parallel with the circuit

<p>&#40;3&#41; Remove plug from timing inspection hole in left‐side crankcase.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Continue turning engine slowly until flywheel timing mark is in
center of inspection hole &#40;<a href="#fig_51">fig. 51</a>&#41;. Do not turn engine further.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Install paper gasket and timer head tension &#40;ground&#41; spring on
timer shaft base assembly. Make sure bent ends of tension spring are
facing downward &#40;away from timer base&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; Insert timer shaft and base assembly all the way down into place in
timing gear case cover, trying to locate mark on small end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span> of breaker
cam in position shown in figure 51. Do not install base mounting screws
as yet.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Install timer head assembly so that spark control lever is within
the advance and retard quadrant &#40;<a href="#fig_51">fig. 51</a>&#41;. NOTE: <i>Do not install cover
retainer until later.</i></p>

<p>&#40;8&#41; Fully advance spark lever &#40;push inward toward engine&#41; and observe
how closely mark on breaker cam lines up with breaker lever fiber.
If mark does not line up, lift timer base and turn shaft gear so its
engagement with its driving gear is changed one tooth. Check again
according to breaker cam mark and breaker lever fiber. Repeat this
procedure until gear engagement is obtained which closely alines cam
mark and breaker lever fiber.</p>

<p>&#40;9&#41; See that timer base is turned so that timer to coil wire is toward
rear of engine.</p>

<p>&#40;10&#41; Install timer base screws and lock washers. Make sure that timer
to coil wire shielding is grounded under head of screw farthest away
from engine &#40;<a href="#fig_52">fig. 52</a>&#41;. Securely tighten screws.</p>

<p>&#40;11&#41; Install timer head on base and secure with ground spring and cover
retainer. Be sure ground spring is in its proper place so that when
cover retainer ends are fitted through holes in the timer head, they
will also fit into spring locating notches. It will be necessary to
press ground spring upward under timer base to engage retainer ends
in the spring notches. NOTE: <i>If cover retainer ends do not engage
ground spring notches, spring will have no tension and timer head
will be loose on its base.</i> Circuit breaker points and condenser are
electrically grounded through timer base, and ground spring holds the
head and base in close contact, thus assuring a good ground.</p>

<p>&#40;12&#41; Connect spark control wire and timer lever and adjust &#40;par. <a href="#para_88">88</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;13&#41; Engine is now timed according to original factory setting,
providing mark on side of timer head and hole in head adjusting band
are still in alinement, and circuit breaker point gap is 0.022 inch.

outlined in the foregoing instructions, it is advisable to accurately
check ignition timing &#40;step <b>d</b> following&#41;.</p>

<p><b>d. Recommended Recheck of Ignition Timing</b> &#40;<a href="#fig_51">fig. 51</a>&#41;.
Even though all ignition timing marks are in perfect alinement, as
when engine was originally timed, ignition timing may change somewhat
after engine has been in service for a while, due to normal wear and
seating of the various moving parts that can affect ignition timing.
Since accurate ignition timing is the first essential to good engine
performance, it is advisable to check ignition timing on new vehicle
after first 1,500 miles of service, and at each 2,000 miles thereafter.</p>

<i>Figure 59—Removing Generator Strap Nut</i></p></div>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Lift strap high enough to permit raising generator so that oil
slinger &#40;on end of generator gear&#41; will clear adjacent gear, and allow
generator to be removed from engine. Be sure to observe and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span> count
number of paper shims between generator and cradle. Lay these shims
aside to be used again when generator is reinstalled. Also, note
location of hole in shims for oil drain. These shims were required in
original assembly to adjust driving gears for proper mesh and, if left
out, gears may mesh too deeply and “howl,” even though considerably
worn. Unless a new generator gasket is available, to be used when
generator is reinstalled, be careful not to damage the old one.</p>

<h4 id="para_94">94. INSTALL GENERATOR.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> When installing generator, the important point to consider is
correct shimming of generator in its cradle to provide correct mesh of
driving gear with intermediate timing gear. Make sure same number of
paper shims are used in reassembling as were found underneath generator
when it was removed. After an engine has been run a considerable
length of time and gears have worn to some extent, they have possibly
developed sufficient lash or play to safely remove one or more of the
original shims, and thus affect closer meshing and quieter operation.
However, this should not be done unless timing gear case cover is
removed so that gear mesh and lash can be carefully checked.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Pass generator drive gear end through gear case hole, lifting
generator so that oil slinger clears intermediate timing gear. Turn
generator in its cradle so that end holes line up with long mounting
screws which pass through gear case cover. Tighten mounting screws
securely.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Install curved washer, lock washer, and nut on end of clamp strap;
tighten nut securely.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Connect red‐black wire to generator terminal marked RELAY, and
green wire to generator terminal marked SWITCH. Refer to wiring diagram
&#40;<a href="#fig_55">fig. 55</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Operate engine and check generator for current output, as well as
check for gear noise. If shimming under generator is proper, generator
and timing gears will run quietly. If necessary, readjust shimming
until gears operate quietly.</p>

<h4 id="para_95">95. CUT‐OUT RELAY.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Operation of the instrument panel green signal light,
indicating generator charge, is controlled by the cut‐out relay.
Therefore, if relay is faulty the signal light will not operate
properly, falsely indicating generator trouble. Rust around the contact
points, burned points, and loss of armature spring tension are sources
of most relay trouble. NOTE: <i>Before condemning a relay because of
failure of green signal light, make light test</i> &#40;par. <a href="#para_120">120</a>&#41;.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<p><b>b.</b> Correct adjustment of relay point gaps and tensioning of
armature springs require use of precision electric meters and expert
knowledge on the subject. A faulty relay, other than removing cover and
cleaning with air, should be replaced. No adjustment of points should
be attempted.</p>

<p><b>c. Remove.</b></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Disconnect the three wires from relay terminal screws.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Remove the two mounting screws and lock washers. Remove relay from
engine base.</p>

<p><b>d. Install.</b></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Mount relay on engine base with two screws and lock washers. Make
sure that mounting is clean to make good electrical ground contact
between relay and engine.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Reconnect the three wire terminals to relay terminal screws. Follow
wiring diagram, figure 55.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Operate engine and observe action of relay, also action of
instrument panel green signal light to indicate generator charge.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Remove front mudguard, after removing nuts and locks from rear
rocker plate studs, two screws and nuts securing mudguard to rigid
fork, and the two bolts mounting headlight bracket to mudguard. NOTE:
<i>Front mudguard blackout light wire connects to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span> ignition and light
switch and care must be exercised not to break this wire if it is not
disconnected from the switch.</i></p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; Disconnect battery negative ground wire at frame connection. Remove
blackout light &#40;par. <a href="#para_114">114</a>&#41;. Remove headlight, horn, and bracket assembly
as one unit.</p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Remove handle bar brake fittings and brake control wire housing
from side of fork. Remove handle bars after removing handle bar bracket
lock nut and cone lock plate. It is not necessary to disconnect spark
and throttle control wire housings from frame. Unscrew fork upper
adjusting cone from fork stem, freeing fork assembly to be removed
from frame head. NOTE: <i>Steering head ball bearings are loose &#40;not in
retainers&#41; in upper and lower frame head bearing cups. Take care not to
lose balls.</i></p>

<p><b>h. Install Fork Assembly.</b> With vehicle on rear stand, and
front end up by blocking under frame loop or skid plate, proceed with
installing fork assembly, as follows:</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Thoroughly clean upper and lower frame head bearing cups and pack
with general purpose grease No. 2, installing fifteen <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>16</sub>&ndash;inch ball
bearings in each cup. Work grease thoroughly in between balls.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; See that lower fork stem cone is clean and in place, pass fork stem
up through frame head, turning on upper adjusting cone. Do not try to
adjust bearing cone as yet.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Install handle bars by locating mounting bracket on ends of fork
sides and center stem, making sure that spark and throttle control wire
housings are in place.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Adjust upper fork stem adjusting cone so that there is no
perceptible shake in head bearings when handle bars are worked up and
down, and fork does not bind when turned to right and left extremes.</p>

<p>&#40;5&#41; Install cone lock plate by engaging pin in one of the cone notches.</p>

<p>&#40;6&#41; Install lock nut on stem and tighten securely. NOTE: <i>Check head
bearing play, as tightening lock nut sometimes makes head bearing too
tight. Readjust if necessary.</i></p>

<p>&#40;7&#41; Attach handle bar brake fittings and brake control wire housing to
side of fork.</p>

<p>&#40;8&#41; Reinstall headlight, horn, and bracket assembly. Connect wires &#40;per
wiring diagram <a href="#fig_73">fig. 73</a>&#41; before front mudguard is reinstalled. Install
blackout light &#40;par. <a href="#para_114">114</a>&#41;. Reconnect battery negative ground wire to
frame ground connection.</p>

<p>&#40;9&#41; Install steering damper &#40;par. <a href="#para_99">99</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;10&#41; Install front mudguard. Attach two screws, washers, and nuts for
rigid fork mounting and two bolts, washers, and nuts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span> headlight
bracket mounting. Fit right and left mudguard brace clip locks to right
and left side rocker plate studs respectively. Do not put on nuts until
after installing ammunition box carrier and scabbard carrier.</p>

<p>&#40;11&#41; Install front wheel &#40;par. <a href="#para_125">125</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;12&#41; Install scabbard carrier and ammunition box carrier &#40;par. <a href="#para_103">103</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;13&#41; Check lights, horn, spark control, throttle control, front brake
control, steering damper control, and steering head bearing for freedom
without binding.</p>

<p><b>i. Remove Rocker Plate Studs.</b> Studs and/or rocker plates
can be removed and installed in the same operation. In removing
and installing studs, remove only one fork rocker plate at a time,
leaving the other plate attached to opposite side fork ends to hold
fork springs in compressed position. This will eliminate necessity of
compressing fork springs to fit rocker plates on studs.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Remove front wheel &#40;par. <a href="#para_125">125</a>&#41;.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Remove nuts and locks from rocker plate studs on right side of
vehicle. This releases gun scabbard carrier and mudguard stay clip.
NOTE: <i>Remove the large nut which secures the long stud to rigid fork.</i></p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Drive out studs from fork ends, releasing rocker plate.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Install studs and rocker plate before removing studs from left side
of vehicle.</p>

<p><b>j. Install Rocker Plate Studs.</b> Apply grease to studs and
insert in rocker plate, then install large flat washers on studs before
mounting this assembly on fork ends. Make sure that short stud is in
front position, and that long stud is in rear position for the rigid
fork.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Drift studs &#40;with plate assembly&#41; into fork end holes from the
inside.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Install special nut lock &#40;with half round hole&#41; on front stud and
turn stud as necessary to make lock “cup” over end of fork. Install
and tighten stud nut and bend up end of lock for security. Place lock
washer over long stud and install thick nut, securely tightening it.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Attach end of gun scabbard carrier and mudguard brace clip with
special lock to long stud, replacing washer and nut.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; After right side rocker plate and/or studs have been installed,
remove and install studs and/or plate on left side of vehicle following
same step‐by‐step procedure as above. The exceptions will be ammunition
box carrier instead of scabbard carrier; also, the left side front stud
is special, having a “button” end.</p>

by the ignition and light switch, all wires terminate at the ignition
and light switch. Cables for wire protection are used, making it
necessary to replace cables rather than individual wires. A study of
figure 73 will be helpful when removing or installing any of the wiring
cables. Also study figures 78 and 79 and note how cables are arranged
on frame, and how they lead to the switch panel.</p>

<p><b>b. Remove and Install Cables.</b> When it becomes necessary
to replace wiring cables leading to the ignition and light switch, both
fuel and oil tanks must be removed &#40;par. <a href="#para_107">107</a>&#41; and instrument panel

<h4 id="para_122">122. DESCRIPTION.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Wheels have drop center rims to accommodate 4.00 x 18 tires.
Front and rear wheels are not interchangeable. Front wheel hub is
of ball‐bearing design, having cone adjustment similar to that of a
bicycle hub. Rear wheel hub is of roller‐bearing design and must be
taken apart for adjustment. Both wheels have “knock‐out” type axles.</p>

<h4 id="para_123">123. TIRES.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a. Description.</b> Wheel rims are of the drop‐center type,
having a depression, or well, in center of rim. The rim well, being
smaller in circumference than the rest of the rim, allows one casing
bead to fit loosely in it while other bead is being worked over edge of
rim. Bear in mind the importance of keeping one bead in rim well while
other bead is being worked onto or off rim. NOTE: <i>It is not always
necessary to completely remove casing from rim. Removing one side only
allows inner tube to be removed and reinstalled, and also allows inside
of casing to be inspected.</i></p>

<p><b>b. Remove.</b></p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Remove wheel from vehicle and lay wheel on its side. To remove
front wheel, refer to paragraph <a href="#para_125">125</a>. To remove rear wheel, refer to
paragraph <a href="#para_127">127</a>.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Remove valve cap and valve core to free all air from tube.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Press casing head into rim well to within a short distance of each
side of valve.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Using tire iron “B” in vehicle kit &#40;<a href="#fig_11">fig. 11</a>&#41;, start bead over edge
of rim at valve. Do not use force when starting bead over edge of rim
with tire iron, because bead wires may be broken or stretched, and tire
ruined. With first bead in rim well, bead on other side can be started
easily over edge of rim. After a portion of second bead is started over
rim edge, casing can be further removed from wheel without aid of tire
iron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span></p>

<p><b>c. Install.</b> Before applying casing to rim, see that
rubber rim strip is in place in rim well and that rim strip valve hole
alines with valve hole in rim.</p>

<p>&#40;1&#41; Start either bead of casing over rim edge. Work around wheel until
entire bead is on rim.</p>

<p>&#40;2&#41; Place inner tube in casing. NOTE: <i>Inner tube may be placed in
casing before or after first bead of casing is on rim.</i> Insert valve
stem through hole in rim and start valve stem lock nut. While pressing
first bead into rim well, work remaining bead over edge of rim,
starting directly opposite valve stem. Work both ways around wheel
toward valve.</p>

<p>&#40;3&#41; Inflate front tire to 18 pounds, and rear tire to 20 pounds.</p>

<p>&#40;4&#41; Reinstall front wheel &#40;par. <a href="#para_125">125</a>&#41;: reinstall wheel &#40;par. <a href="#para_127">127</a>&#41;.
CAUTION: <i>Tire casings are balanced and must be applied to rim with
balance mark located at valve stem. On Firestone tires the balance mark
is a red triangle, and on Goodyear tires a red dot.</i></p>

<h4 id="para_124">124. RIMS AND SPOKES.</h4>

<p class="p1"><b>a.</b> Wheels with broken and or missing spokes, with rims in badly
kinked and or distorted condition, or having considerable run‐out, must
be replaced.</p>

<p><b>b.</b> Loose wheel spokes must be tightened evenly, being careful
not to distort rim out‐of‐round or cause run‐out. Use spoke nipple
wrench &#40;41&ndash;W&ndash;3339&#41; for front wheel spokes, and wrench &#40;41&ndash;W&ndash;3340&#41; for
rear wheel spokes.</p>

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
